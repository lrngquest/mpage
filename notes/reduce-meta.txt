Further analysis of proposed file for v2d :: v2.4 raised questions --
 although the  v2d  file date is _later_ than  v2c  file date,
 the contents seem similar to an earlier functional version!

Searching contemporary sources for the (closest, i.e. mimimal diff)
   $ diff -u -w v1c/core.clj v2d/core.clj |less

       # lines  120   in fn  mp-get-text  text-onepage  do-text-sheet  do-sheets
       # _all_ in re:  s/loop/reduce/ !  :: a closer match!
This suggests a "branch" for coding experiment, _NOT_ a development step.

How to best describe?

Context
This is a redo of prior code exercise loop -> reduce  which exceeded
its "timebox" without  succeeding.
